      <h2>Abstract </h2>
      <p>
        Estimating geometric parameters can play an important role in
different applications of pattern recognition algorithms. The purpose
of this tutorial is to present new efficient and easy to reproduce
algorithms dedicated to the robust extraction of geometric features on
digital objects. The tutorial will consist of a rapid overview of the
theoretical description of recent estimators (like tangent, curvature
or noise estimators) followed by the implementation details given
through the <a href="http://dgtal.org">DGtal</a> library. To introduce this library,
a quick look of the main features will be presented with preliminary
exercises available online before the tutorial.
      </p>
      <p>
To simplify interaction and demonstration like in teaching activities,
the use of the {\dgtal} library will be embedded in a
\textit{Jupyter} notebook allowing online demonstration from a single
web browser. In the continuity and complement of this online notebook,
we will propose to the audience to construct its own online
demonstration by using the new automatic demonstration kernel recently
proposed in the Image Processing On Line journal.
